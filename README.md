# Schwarzschild Radius

Schwarzschild Radius is loosely based on a game I played almost a decade ago. If you remember the game called Dark Galaxy, this may be for you.

This game will never be in 'production' unless someone desperately wants me to release it. I will, however, allow users to join and play but with the knowledge that it will always be under active develoment.

So why did I choose Schwarzschild Radius? Well, the name is based on the theoretical concept that if you continue to shrink an object, that object will collapse to form a blackhole. Earth, once shrunk, forms a blackhole when the size reaches 9 mm. Absolutely
fascinating. 

I would like to implement this idea into a weapon that can be utilised in the game. 

## Features Implemented

* Simple GUI - Not really but you can edit parameters :)
*

## Direction and Future Development

Well to be honest, this list will be huge so I'm not going to write it all down. 
I'll write a comprehensive road map in the months or years a head. 

* Trade
* Combat
* etc
