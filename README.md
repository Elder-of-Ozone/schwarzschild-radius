# schwarzschild-radius

This is a clone of a game I used to play almost a decade ago.

The premise is simple. The objective is to increase your planets economy. Use resources to build up your armies and spaceships. 

When you think you're strong enough, take over nearby planets by invasion or through peace treaties.
