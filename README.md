# Schwarzschild Radius

Schwarzschild Radius is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game. It is loosely based on a game I played almost a decade ago called Dark Galaxy. If you remember the game, this may be for you.

I will never put this into 'production' unless someone desperately wants me to release it. I will, however, allow users to join once a proper database is up. Be aware that it will always be under develoment.

## What is in the name?

So what is in a name? That's a typical question that often gets asked on almost every application. 
So why did I choose Schwarzschild Radius? Well, the name is based on the theoretical limit of an objection compressed to form a black hole. Earth, once shrunk, forms a blackhole when the size reaches 9 mm. Absolutely
fascinating. 

I would like to implement this idea into a weapon that can be utilised in the game. 

## Currently Implemented
* Simple menu GUI - Not really but you can edit parameters :)
* Save and load objects
* Limited turns

## Working On
### Priority [#]
* Turn system [1]
* Queue system [2]

### Database
* Current method: Pickle
	* Automatically store and import objects [COMPLETED]
* Migrate to SQL [5] //This is very low on the agenda 

### Galaxy
* visualise the galaxy. 
	* Have in place obstacles similar to how FTL that affect systems.
		* This will make gameplay a bit more tactical


### Economics
* Population dynamics

### Resources
* Resource Dynamics

### Trade
* None

### Combat
* None

## Direction and Future Development

Well to be honest, this list will be huge so I'm not going to write it all down. 
I'll write a comprehensive road map in the months or years a head. 

* Trade
* Combat
* etc
