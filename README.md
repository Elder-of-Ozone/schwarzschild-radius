# Schwarzschild Radius

Schwarzschild Radius is a multiplier turn-based strategy game. It is loosely based on a game I played almost a decade ago called Dark Galaxy. If you remember the game, this may be for you.

This game will never be in 'production' unless someone desperately wants me to release it. I will, however, allow users to join and play but with the knowledge that it will always be under active develoment.

So why did I choose Schwarzschild Radius? Well, the name is based on the theoretical concept that if you continue to shrink an object, that object will collapse to form a blackhole. Earth, once shrunk, forms a blackhole when the size reaches 9 mm. Absolutely
fascinating. 

I would like to implement this idea into a weapon that can be utilised in the game.
