# schwarzschild-radius

This is a clone of a game I used to play almost a decade ago.

The premise is simple. Take control of your planets economy to increase your resources. Use these resources to build up your armies and spaceships. 

When you think you're strong enough, take over nearby planets by invasion or through peace treaties.
